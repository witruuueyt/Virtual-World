The main purpose of the virtual world is to take players on a tour of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the largest palace in China. Together with the Hall of Central Harmony and Hall of Preserving Harmony, the three halls constitute the heart of the Outer Court of the Forbidden City.
Players can watch the entire palace up close in the virtual world, as well as read the background story related to the palace.
